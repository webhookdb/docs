WebhookDB is modeled after the way a **reservoir** works.

Reservoirs for water have the following key components:

- **Rain, springs, and snow melt**, which happen over a wide area.
- The **Basin** collects this water and channels it towards a valley.
- The **Dam** is built at the narrow point of the valley.
- The **Lake** (or **Reservoir**) is the lake that forms behind the dam.
- **Treatment plants** take this relatively clean lake water and ensure it is safe for human consumption.
- Water is then **piped** to where we need it, when we need it,
  providing most of the drinking water in the world.

WebhookDB works the same way:

- **APIs** (your own and 3rd parties) produce data, lots of data, unique to the API.
- WebhookDB workers collect this data into a **Data Basin** using webhooks, periodic polling, and more.
- This data is schematized and normalized into the **Data Reservoir.**
- An SQL database (Postgres, though MySQL is in alpha) acts as the **Dam**, giving you access to the reservoir.
- Because it is just an SQL database, the data can use your existing **pipes**;
  there's no need to learn, deploy, and manage new technology or services on your critical path,
  like GraphQL or gRPC.
