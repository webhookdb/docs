# `webhookdb`

webhookdb - CLI for WebhookDB <https://github.com/webhookdb/webhookdb>.
WebhookDB replicates any API into a database,
so you have immediate, reliable access to all your data.

To create an account and get started, run:

    webhookdb auth login

The CLI will guide you from there.

The CLI also gives you quick access to the WebhookDB documentation:

    webhookdb docs html # Open a browser to https://docs.webhookdb.com
