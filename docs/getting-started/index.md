# Getting Started

This guide shows you how to get started with effortless API integrations using WebhookDB.
It steps you through installing the `webhookdb` CLI, setting up your first service integration (replicator),
backfilling historical data, querying the synced data, and writing unit tests against WebhookDB
rather than API mocking. Finally it points you at monitoring webhook deliveries,
and more complex replication features.

Completing this guide should take less than 15 minutes. You can use [WebhookDB Cloud](https://webhookdb.com)
to get going, or [run WebhookDB locally]({% link _guides/run-locally.md %}).
