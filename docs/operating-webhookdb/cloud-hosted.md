# WebhookDB Cloud

You don't have to operate anything this way. We run everything.

- Webhooks are sent to our servers.
- Any API keys you provide are stored in our application database.
- The data we store on your behalf sits on one of our shared database servers.
- We maintain the database users and hosts (you only have read-only access).

See more information at [webhookdb.com](https://webhookdb.com).
