# Self-Hosting WebhookDB

Self-hosting WebhookDB gives you total control over your data and performance.
Thankfully, WebhookDB is designed to be very easy to host,
working out of the box in any environment. You can deploy it in exactly the same way you deploy existing applications.

See the extensive [Guide to Self Hosting]({% link _guides/self-hosting.md %}) for more details.
